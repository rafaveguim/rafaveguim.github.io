Leftover is a place where I dump bits of research (small tools, methods, analyses,
  and data visualizations) that are useful or interesting, but not revolutionary
  enough to be in a research paper.
I'm a Toronto-based data visualization (project of) researcher, PhD candidate
 at UOIT, and member of the [vialab](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/) research group.
